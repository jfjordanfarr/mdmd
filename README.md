# mdmd

Membrane Design MarkDown (MDMD) is a strategy for specifying general solutions that utilizes a _bilayer_ of specifications: A "unit" layer (lower-level, 1:1 mapping from .md to implementation), and a "composition" layer (higher-level, many-to-many mapping). The specification is built specifically to enhance AI-assisted and AI-driven development.
