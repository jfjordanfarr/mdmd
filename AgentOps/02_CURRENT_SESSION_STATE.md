## Agent State - MDMD Project

- **Agent Version:** GitHub Copilot
- **LLM Used:** Copilot's internal model
- **Current Overall Goal:** Synchronize MDMD repository specifications and directive implementations with comprehensive improvements developed in Open Sprunk Framework project.
- **Current Sub-Task:** Update core MDMD specification and primitive directives to match enhanced recursive bilayer/strata model with improved ID conventions and cross-reference patterns.
- **Current Focus Document:** `MDMD_Specification/MDMD.md`, `MDMD_Specification/Primitives/UnitDirective.myst.md`, `MDMD_Specification/Primitives/CompositionDirective.myst.md`.
- **Overall Plugin Progress:** Plugin loads and executes! Previous session achieved working MyST plugin with correct option parsing. Current task is to upgrade specifications to enhanced model.

## Log of Key Actions / Decisions / Issues (Newest First)

- **2025-06-02 - NEW TASK INITIATED: Synchronize MDMD repo with Open Sprunk Framework improvements.** User provided code dump with enhanced MDMD specification featuring recursive bilayer/strata model, improved ID conventions (kebab-case), enhanced cross-reference patterns, and strata-aware architecture (Definition/Vision, Definition/Requirements, Specification/Concepts, Specification/Implementations).
- **2025-06-01 - PREVIOUS SESSION VICTORY: `myst build` with camelCase YAML frontmatter options in `test-doc.myst.md` and camelCase options in `DirectiveSpec` SUCCEEDED!** Console logs from `run()` methods appeared, confirming options are parsed correctly. Plugin functionality established.
- **2025-06-01 - Plugin loads successfully, directive `run()` methods execute, options parsing works correctly with camelCase YAML frontmatter and camelCase DirectiveSpec options.**

## Agent Notes & Reminders (Focus for this Session)

- **Primary Goal:** Update MDMD repository to match Open Sprunk Framework improvements.
  - **Task 1:** Replace `MDMD_Specification/MDMD.md` with enhanced recursive bilayer/strata model
  - **Task 2:** Update `MDMD_Specification/Primitives/UnitDirective.myst.md` with enhanced specification
  - **Task 3:** Update `MDMD_Specification/Primitives/CompositionDirective.myst.md` with enhanced specification
  - **Task 4:** Update TypeScript directive implementations to match new specifications
  - **Task 5:** Validate plugin still builds and works with MyST after updates

## Key Improvements from Open Sprunk Framework:

1. **Recursive Bilayer/Strata Model**: Four semantic strata (Definition/Vision, Definition/Requirements, Specification/Concepts, Specification/Implementations) with recursive bilayer within each stratum
2. **Enhanced ID Conventions**: Kebab-case format for IDs with optional human-readable `title` attributes
3. **Improved Cross-Reference Patterns**: Comprehensive linking strategies with unidirectional dependency flow and strategic bidirectional navigation
4. **Strata-Aware Content**: Different content patterns and expectations based on stratum and directive type
5. **Enhanced DirectiveSpec Contracts**: Detailed option specifications, enhanced parsing logic, improved AST node structures

## Immediate Next Step for AI Assistant

1. **Update `MDMD_Specification/MDMD.md`** with the enhanced recursive bilayer/strata model from Open Sprunk Framework
2. **Update `MDMD_Specification/Primitives/UnitDirective.myst.md`** with enhanced unit directive specification
3. **Update `MDMD_Specification/Primitives/CompositionDirective.myst.md`** with enhanced composition directive specification
4. **Update TypeScript directive implementations** (`src/directives/unitDirective.ts` and `src/directives/compositionDirective.ts`) to match new specifications
5. **Test build pipeline** (`npm run clean && npm run build`) to ensure no regressions
6. **Test MyST functionality** (`myst build test-doc.myst.md --html`) to verify plugin still works correctly
7. **Update Session State** with progress and results

# Current Session State

## Current Task
Updating README.md to reflect the more nuanced MDMD specification, including:
- Recursive bilayer/strata model
- Four-stratum organization
- Enhanced ID conventions and cross-reference standards
- Dependency direction guidelines
- More accurate examples

## Recent Context
- Reviewed MDMD specification documents showing the recursive bilayer/strata architecture
- The specification has evolved to include:
  - Definition/Vision stratum
  - Definition/Requirements stratum
  - Specification/Concepts stratum
  - Specification/Implementations stratum
- Each stratum contains its own bilayer of compositions (outer) and units (inner)
- Enhanced linking patterns with specific dependency directions

## Next Steps
1. Update README.md with the recursive bilayer/strata model
2. Revise examples to show proper ID conventions (kebab-case)
3. Add visual representation of the four-stratum organization
4. Update goals to reflect current plugin capabilities
5. Enhance the vision section with the recursive architecture concept
