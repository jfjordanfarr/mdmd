## Agent State - MDMD Project

- **Agent Version:** GitHub Copilot
- **LLM Used:** Copilot's internal model
- **Current Overall Goal:** Successfully build the MDMD MyST plugin, ensure it loads correctly in MyST, correctly parses directive options and body, and eliminate build warnings.
- **Current Sub-Task:** Resolve `myst build` warnings: "unexpected body provided" and "extra key ignored: myst".
- **Current Focus Document:** `src/directives/unitDirective.ts`, `src/directives/compositionDirective.ts`, and `test-doc.myst.md`.
- **Overall Plugin Progress:** Plugin loads and executes! `run()` methods are called, and options (camelCase in YAML frontmatter) are correctly parsed. Build system (`esbuild` + `tsc`) is functional. Remaining issues are warnings.

## Log of Key Actions / Decisions / Issues (Newest First)

- **2025-06-01 - VICTORY! `myst build` with camelCase YAML frontmatter options in `test-doc.myst.md` and camelCase options in `DirectiveSpec` SUCCEEDED! Console logs from `run()` methods appeared, confirming options are parsed correctly. This is a major breakthrough.**
- **2025-06-01 - Modified `test-doc.myst.md` to use camelCase keys in YAML frontmatter (e.g., `unitType: "value"`).**
- **2025-06-01 - `myst build` with YAML frontmatter options (kebab-case keys) in `test-doc.myst.md`. Output shows MyST expects camelCase keys in YAML (e.g., `required option "unitType" not provided` and `unexpected option "unit-type" provided`). `console.log` statements still not appearing.**
- **2025-06-01 - Switched `test-doc.myst.md` to use YAML frontmatter for options, based on MyST documentation examples. Initial attempt used kebab-case keys in the YAML.**
- **2025-06-01 - User provided `myst build` output. Build successful. `myst build` shows plugin loaded but option errors persist (e.g., `required option "id" not provided`). `console.log` statements from directive `run` methods are NOT appearing. This indicates MyST validation fails before `run` method sees the options.**
- **2025-06-01 - User confirmed continuation. Current test was with colon-prefixed option syntax in `test-doc.myst.md` (e.g., `:id: value`) and directives expecting kebab-case options and defined `arg`.**
- **2025-06-01 - User provided `myst build` output. Using camelCase attributes in `test-doc.myst.md` (e.g., `unitType="value"`) with directives expecting camelCase options also FAILED.** Errors remain: `required option "id" not provided`, `required option "unitType" not provided`. Console logs from `run` functions are still NOT appearing. This is perplexing as MyST validation seems to expect camelCase (based on error messages) but isn't receiving/parsing options correctly from Markdown.
- **2025-06-01 - User provided `myst build` output. Colon-prefixed syntax in `test-doc.myst.md` (e.g., `:id: value`) did NOT resolve option parsing errors.** Errors remain: `required option "id" not provided`, `required option "unitType" not provided` (and similar for composition). Console logs from directive `run` functions are still NOT appearing. This suggests MyST validation fails before `run` is called. The errors asking for `unitType` (camelCase) imply `DirectiveSpec.options` are likely defined in camelCase by the user.
- **2025-06-01 - User confirmed continuation. Current test is with colon-prefixed option syntax in `test-doc.myst.md` (e.g., `:id: value`) and directives expecting kebab-case options and defined `arg`.**
- **2025-06-01 - User provided session state. Proceeding with outlined plan to fix option parsing.**
- **2025-06-01 - User provided `myst build` output.** Errors persist for option handling in `unit` and `composition`
  directives (e.g., `required option "id" not provided`, `required option "unitType" not provided`,
  `unexpected option "id" provided`, `unexpected option "unit-type" provided`). This is after attempting to use
  camelCase keys in `DirectiveSpec.options`.


- **2025-06-01 - Modified `src/directives/compositionDirective.ts`** to use kebab-case for option keys in
  `DirectiveSpec.options` and bracket notation in the `run` function. Added `console.log`.
- **2025-06-01 - Modified `src/directives/unitDirective.ts`** to use kebab-case for option keys in `DirectiveSpec.options`
  and bracket notation in the `run` function. Added `console.log`.
- **2025-06-01 - Modified `.markdownlint.json`** to disable MD013 (line-length) and other stylistic rules globally.
- **2025-06-01 - User requested to disable non-critical markdownlint rules, especially line length (MD013).**
- **2025-06-01 - `myst build test-doc.myst.md --html` output shows the plugin is LOADED!** Initial option errors
  appeared, pointing to option name casing issues in the `DirectiveSpec`.
- 2025-06-01 - Build successful with `esbuild` and `tsc --emitDeclarationOnly`. `dist` directory contains `index.mjs`,
  `index.mjs.map`, and declaration files (`*.d.ts`, `*.d.ts.map`). `noEmit` in `tsconfig.json` was temporarily set to
  `false` to allow `tsc` to emit declaration files, then build was re-run.
- 2025-06-01 - Corrected `tsconfig.json` by changing `module` to `ESNext` (from `NodeNext`) to resolve `tsc` errors with
  `moduleResolution: "Bundler"`. Build still only produced `index.mjs` and `index.mjs.map` (no .d.ts files).
- 2025-06-01 - `npm run clean && npm run build` failed. `tsc` (for `build:types`) errored because
  `moduleResolution: "Bundler"` is not compatible with `module: "NodeNext"`.
- 2025-06-01 - `src/index.ts` imports are already extensionless. No changes were needed.
- 2025-06-01 - User confirmed next step is to modify `src/index.ts` for extensionless imports (this was already the
  case).
- 2025-06-01 - User, with input from Long Context Gemini, decided to abandon the `rename-output` script strategy due to
  its brittleness. New strategy: use `esbuild` to bundle the TypeScript plugin into ESM (`.mjs`) format, with `tsc`
  handling type declaration generation.**
- 2025-06-01 - User ran `npm run clean && npm run build` (with manually edited `package.json`). Build succeeded, but
  inspection of `dist/index.mjs` showed import paths still referenced `.js` files. The Perl regex in `rename-output`
  was not working as intended.
- 2025-06-01 - User ran `npm run clean && npm run build`. Build succeeded. Inspection of `dist/index.mjs` shows import
  paths still reference `.js` files. The Perl regex in `rename-output` needs further correction.**
- 2025-06-01 - `npm run build` failed again with `EJSONPARSE` in `package.json`. The escaping of the Perl regex was
  still problematic. User manually edited `package.json`.
- 2025-06-01 - `npm run build` succeeded. However, inspection of `dist/index.mjs` shows the Perl script in
  `rename-output` incorrectly changed import paths to `from '.mjs'`. The regex needed correction.
- 2025-06-01 - Corrected escaping for `rename-output` script in `package.json`. `npm run build` failed with `sh: 1:
  Syntax error: "&&" unexpected`. This indicates a problem with how the chained `find` commands (or their `-exec`
  payloads) are being parsed by the shell, likely due to quoting/escaping issues in `package.json` for the
  `rename-output` script.
- 2025-06-01 - Attempted to use Perl in `rename-output`. Build still failed with `EJSONPARSE` initially, then with
  shell syntax errors after fixing JSON.
- 2025-06-01 - `npm run build` failed due to `EJSONPARSE` in `package.json`. The `sed` command in `rename-output`
  had incorrect escaping. Attempting a Perl-based solution for in-file replacements.
- 2025-06-01 - `myst build` still fails with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. The compiled `dist/index.mjs` has `import ... from
  './directives/unitDirective.js'`, but the target file is `dist/directives/unitDirective.mjs`. The `rename-output`
  script needs to also update these internal import paths.

## Agent Notes & Reminders (Focus for this Session)

- **Primary Goal:** Eliminate remaining `myst build` warnings.
  - **Warning 1: `unexpected body provided for directive: unit` (and `composition`)**
    - **Hypothesis:** `DirectiveSpec` in `unitDirective.ts` and `compositionDirective.ts` does not explicitly declare a `body` field.
    - **Solution:** Add `body: { type: String, required: false, doc: '...' } as OptionDefinition` to both directive specs.
  - **Warning 2: `'frontmatter' extra key ignored: myst`**
    - **Hypothesis:** `myst: 1.0` in `test-doc.myst.md` frontmatter is not a page-level key.
    - **Solution:** Remove `myst: 1.0` from `test-doc.myst.md` frontmatter.
- Console logs in directives are invaluable and should be kept for now.

## Immediate Next Step for AI Assistant

1.  ~~Update this session state document.~~ (Completed)
2.  **Modify `src/directives/unitDirective.ts` AND `src/directives/compositionDirective.ts`:**
    *   Add the `body` property to their `DirectiveSpec` objects as outlined above.
    *   Ensure `OptionDefinition` is imported from `myst-common`.
3.  **Modify `test-doc.myst.md`:**
    *   Remove the line `myst: 1.0` from its YAML frontmatter.
4.  **Run `npm run clean && npm run build`.**
5.  **Run `myst build test-doc.myst.md --html` and report full console output.**
6.  **Analyze output, hoping warnings are resolved.**
7.  **Update Session State.**
