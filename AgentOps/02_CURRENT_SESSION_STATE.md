## Agent State - MDMD Project

- **Agent Version:** GitHub Copilot
- **LLM Used:** Copilot's internal model
- **Current Overall Goal:** Ensure robust and functional MDMD project infrastructure, including documentation deployment.
- **Current Sub-Task:** Fix MyST build errors (invalid nav URLs and frontmatter) and then troubleshoot GitHub Pages 404 error.
- **Current Focus Document:** `docs/myst.yml`, `docs/Compositions/index.md`, `/.github/workflows/docs.yml`.
- **Overall Plugin Progress:** Plugin core functionality established. Documentation build and deployment is the current focus.

## Log of Key Actions / Decisions / Issues (Newest First)

- **2025-06-04 - MyST build errors identified.**
  - Invalid nav URLs in `docs/myst.yml`.
  - Invalid YAML frontmatter in `docs/Compositions/index.md`.
  - Added `--html` flag to `myst build` command in `docs.yml`.
- **2025-06-04 - Troubleshooting GitHub Pages 404 error.**
  - Removed duplicate workflow file `/.github/workflows/github-pages`.
  - Initial check of `docs/_build/site/` revealed missing `index.html` at the root.
  - Attempted rebuilds encountered issues with command execution pathing and missing `--html` flag.
- **2025-06-04 - NEW TASK INITIATED: Troubleshoot GitHub Pages 404 error.** User reports that despite a seemingly successful workflow run (`docs.yml`), the GitHub Pages site shows a 404 error. Two workflow files exist: `docs.yml` and `github-pages` (the latter likely without a `.yml` extension).
- **2025-06-02 - PREVIOUS TASK: Synchronize MDMD repo with Open Sprunk Framework improvements.** User provided code dump with enhanced MDMD specification. (This task is paused to address Pages issue).
- **2025-06-01 - PREVIOUS SESSION VICTORY (Local/Build): `myst build` with camelCase YAML frontmatter options in `test-doc.myst.md` and camelCase options in `DirectiveSpec` SUCCEEDED!** Console logs from `run()` methods appeared, confirming options are parsed correctly. Plugin functionality established.

## Agent Notes & Reminders (Focus for this Session)

- **Primary Goal:** Resolve the 404 error on the GitHub Pages site.
  - **Task 1:** Fix errors in `docs/myst.yml` (nav URLs) and `docs/Compositions/index.md` (frontmatter).
  - **Task 2:** Ensure `docs/_build/site/` contains the necessary `index.html` file at its root after a successful build.
  - **Task 3:** Verify the GitHub Actions workflow (`docs.yml`) correctly builds, uploads, and deploys the artifact.
  - **Task 4:** Check GitHub Pages settings in the repository.

## Key Information from User:
- GitHub Pages is configured to deploy using GitHub Actions.
- The `docs.yml` workflow has run.
- The deployed site shows a 404 error, indicating `index.html` is not found at the root.
- Previous local builds and previews of the documentation were successful.
- User recalls using a `--html` flag with `myst build` previously.

## Immediate Next Step for AI Assistant
1.  Correct the `nav` URLs in `docs/myst.yml`.
2.  Correct the YAML frontmatter in `docs/Compositions/index.md`.
3.  Perform a clean build of the documentation using `npx myst build --html` in the `docs` directory.
4.  Inspect the contents of `docs/_build/site/` to confirm `index.html` is present.
5.  Review the `docs.yml` workflow for any subtle issues related to artifact path or deployment.
6.  Update Session State with findings and next actions.

# Current Session State

## Current Task
Fix MyST build errors and then troubleshoot and resolve the 404 error for the GitHub Pages documentation site.

## Problem Statement
MyST build process is failing due to invalid nav URLs in `docs/myst.yml` and incorrect YAML frontmatter in `docs/Compositions/index.md`. These issues need to be resolved before we can confirm if `index.html` is generated correctly for GitHub Pages deployment.

## Files Involved
- `docs/myst.yml` (Contains invalid nav URLs)
- `docs/Compositions/index.md` (Contains invalid YAML frontmatter)
- `/.github/workflows/docs.yml` (Workflow for building and deploying docs)
- `docs/_build/site/` (Expected location of built static site files)

## Next Steps
1.  **Fix `docs/myst.yml`:** Correct `nav` URLs to be valid relative paths.
2.  **Fix `docs/Compositions/index.md`:** Correct the `title` in the YAML frontmatter.
3.  **Rebuild Documentation:** Execute `cd docs && npx myst build --html`.
4.  **Verify Build Output:** Check if `docs/_build/site/index.html` exists.
5.  **Analyze Workflow & MyST Config:** If `index.html` is still missing or issues persist, re-examine `docs.yml` and `docs/myst.yml`.
6.  **Check GitHub Pages Settings:** Confirm settings in the repository.
7.  **Propose Further Fixes:** Based on findings, suggest modifications.
8.  **Update Session State:** Document actions taken and outcomes.

## Technical Notes from Previous Session (May need re-evaluation)
- MyST builds to `_build/site/` directory successfully. (This needs to be confirmed for the current build being deployed, specifically the presence of `index.html` at the root).
- Plugin loads: "mdmd-primitives (dist/index.mjs) loaded: 2 directives"
- Custom {unit} and {composition} directives render correctly in browser (This was likely a local preview).
