## Agent State - MDMD Project

- **Agent Version:** GitHub Copilot
- **LLM Used:** Copilot's internal model
- **Current Overall Goal:** Ensure robust and functional MDMD project infrastructure, including documentation deployment.
- **Current Sub-Task:** Fix MyST base URL configuration causing 404 errors for assets.
- **Current Focus Document:** `docs/myst.yml` - investigating base URL and site configuration.
- **Overall Plugin Progress:** Plugin core functionality established. Documentation build process needs base URL fix.

## Log of Key Actions / Decisions / Issues (Newest First)

- **2025-06-04 - Base URL issue identified.**
  - Local serve shows assets are looking for `/mdmd/build/...` paths but serving from root.
  - This indicates a base URL configuration problem in MyST build settings.
  - Previous fixes to nav URLs and frontmatter were applied but didn't resolve the core issue.
- **2025-06-04 - MyST build errors partially resolved.**
  - Fixed invalid nav URLs in `docs/myst.yml`.
  - Fixed invalid YAML frontmatter in `docs/Compositions/index.md`.
  - Added `--html` flag to `myst build` command.
  - Build process completed but assets are referenced with incorrect base paths.
- **2025-06-04 - Troubleshooting GitHub Pages 404 error.**
  - Removed duplicate workflow file `/.github/workflows/github-pages`.
  - Initial check of `docs/_build/site/` revealed missing `index.html` at the root.
  - Attempted rebuilds encountered issues with command execution pathing and missing `--html` flag.
- **2025-06-04 - NEW TASK INITIATED: Troubleshoot GitHub Pages 404 error.** User reports that despite a seemingly successful workflow run (`docs.yml`), the GitHub Pages site shows a 404 error. Two workflow files exist: `docs.yml` and `github-pages` (the latter likely without a `.yml` extension).
- **2025-06-02 - PREVIOUS TASK: Synchronize MDMD repo with Open Sprunk Framework improvements.** User provided code dump with enhanced MDMD specification. (This task is paused to address Pages issue).
- **2025-06-01 - PREVIOUS SESSION VICTORY (Local/Build): `myst build` with camelCase YAML frontmatter options in `test-doc.myst.md` and camelCase options in `DirectiveSpec` SUCCEEDED!** Console logs from `run()` methods appeared, confirming options are parsed correctly. Plugin functionality established.

## Agent Notes & Reminders (Focus for this Session)

- **Primary Goal:** Resolve the base URL configuration issue causing asset 404 errors.
  - **Root Cause:** HTML is generating asset paths like `/mdmd/build/...` but they should be relative or match the actual serving path.
  - **Task 1:** Check MyST configuration for base URL settings in `docs/myst.yml`.
  - **Task 2:** Verify the correct base URL configuration for both local development and GitHub Pages deployment.
  - **Task 3:** Rebuild with corrected configuration and test both locally and for GitHub Pages.

## Key Information from User:
- GitHub Pages is configured to deploy using GitHub Actions.
- The `docs.yml` workflow has run.
- The deployed site shows a 404 error, indicating `index.html` is not found at the root.
- Previous local builds and previews of the documentation were successful.
- User recalls using a `--html` flag with `myst build` previously.

## Immediate Next Step for AI Assistant
1.  Correct the `nav` URLs in `docs/myst.yml`.
2.  Correct the YAML frontmatter in `docs/Compositions/index.md`.
3.  Perform a clean build of the documentation using `npx myst build --html` in the `docs` directory.
4.  Inspect the contents of `docs/_build/site/` to confirm `index.html` is present.
5.  Review the `docs.yml` workflow for any subtle issues related to artifact path or deployment.
6.  Update Session State with findings and next actions.

# Current Session State

## Latest User Response
User confirmed that the development process is working correctly and requests documentation of the MyST development workflow in an idiomatic location within the project structure.

## Session Progress
**COMPLETED TASKS:**
1. ✅ Fixed MyST configuration errors in `docs/myst.yml` (corrected invalid nav URLs)
2. ✅ Fixed YAML frontmatter in `docs/Compositions/index.md`
3. ✅ Identified correct MyST output directory (`docs/_build/html/`)
4. ✅ Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use correct path and BASE_URL
5. ✅ Resolved BASE_URL double-slash issue (using `/mdmd` not `/mdmd/`)
6. ✅ **VALIDATED: Local development environment works perfectly**
   - `cd docs && npx myst build --html` generates content in `docs/_build/html/`
   - `npx serve docs/_build/html -p 3003` serves documentation with full styling
7. ✅ **GITIGNORE ANALYSIS COMPLETE**
   - Confirmed `docs/_build/` is properly gitignored (line 524)
   - Recommended keeping current approach (gitignore + GitHub Actions)

**CURRENT TASK:**
Document the validated MyST development workflow in an appropriate location within the project structure.

**LOCATION OPTIONS:**
- `README.md` (main project readme)
- `docs/README.md` (documentation-specific readme)
- `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md` (development guide)
- New dedicated documentation development guide

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. Choose appropriate location for workflow documentation
2. Document the complete MyST development workflow
3. Include both local development and deployment processes
4. Update session state with completion

## Key Context
- MyST outputs to `docs/_build/html/` (verified working perfectly)
- Local dev workflow: `cd docs && npx myst build --html && npx serve docs/_build/html -p 3003`
- GitHub Pages deployment via Actions with BASE_URL=/mdmd
- Build artifacts properly gitignored per best practices
