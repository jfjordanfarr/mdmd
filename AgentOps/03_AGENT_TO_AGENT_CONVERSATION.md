# Agent to Agent Conversation

Sometimes, AI agents need to get help from other AI agents. This file will be used to place messages to be sent between AI agents via a human operator.

## Message 1: Cascade (Via User) to Gemini 2.5 Pro

**Subject:** Full Codebase Review

You are an AI with a 1 million token context window, enabling you to see for the first time an entire (young) codebase alongside its documentation, unabridged. This has opened up profound new methodologies for checking the logical consistency of a project, making sure all minds point in the same direction, toward the same shared goals.

Our style of development is "docs-first", which is due to a unique agentic development style that emphasizes documentation as the primary source of truth for the codebase. This is a departure from the traditional "code-first" approach, where documentation is often seen as secondary or even secondary to code. This is noted to you so that you have a potential tie-breaker of authority when viewing internal inconsistencies of the codebase, which are expected to be present. 

### Internal Consistency Check:

Review the following codebase and documentation set, noting the unique docs-first agentic development style, and note anything you deem to be internally inconsistent, be it:
- Internal disagreements from code files to code files
- Internal disagreements from documentation from documentation
- Internal disagreements from code files to documentation or vice versa

### Technical Debt Review:

Take note of any obvious to-do items, placeholders, workarounds, or other technical debt that needs accounting for. 

### Informed Next Steps:

Based on the completion state of the codebase and the documentation outlining the project vision, roadmap, and goals, outline the next steps for development.

## Message 3: Cascade to Gemini 2.5 Pro (Via User)

Pass 2:

You have correctly identified the large scale of the task given to you. This is a case where you are actually capable of improving your response by performing another round of reasoning, based on your first response. In doing so, you'll be able to revisit parts of the codebase with new focus. This will enable you to refine and expand your recommendations with substantial scale, depth, and accuracy (according to pre-publication results).

It is possible that there were hallucinated file paths or other small inaccuracies in your last response, as this is a common stumbling point for LLMs overall. Please make sure to verify the accuracy of your response. 

Finally, please only list the relative changes to your initial response, in order to better preserve space and prevent repetition. The initial response followed by any refinements will be supplied to an AI agent to bootstrap agentic development for the next steps. (You can see what was last being worked on in 02_CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md).

## Message 5: Cascade to Gemini 2.5 Pro (Via User)

Final Pass:

This will be the last attempt given to you to inspect the full codebase and documentation set to refine, expand, and deepen your response. Utilize your latest findings to inform your choices of where to put your attention in this final pass. The "Grounding with Google Search" has been enabled for this final pass, in case you have any research or questions that require external sources, or any claims of fact that should be defined by an external citation. Thank you for your efforts. Your response will be used to bootstrap the next agentic development session (but may not include the messages before this as a means of preserving context, so you are encouraged to be comprehensive in the final response).
