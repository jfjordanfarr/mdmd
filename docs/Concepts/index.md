# MDMD Concepts

This section contains the foundational concepts that drive the design and implementation of MDMD (Membrane Design MarkDown).

## Core Documents

### [MDMD Philosophy](./CONCEPTS_MDMD_PHILOSOPHY.md)
The overarching vision and philosophical foundations of MDMD as a medium for human-AI collaboration in progressive concretization of ideas.

### [Core Primitives Intent](./CONCEPTS_CORE_PRIMITIVES_INTENT.md)
The intended roles and design principles behind the `{unit}` and `{composition}` directives that form the core of the MDMD language.

## Key Concepts

### Progressive Concretization
MDMD facilitates the gradual transformation of abstract ideas into concrete, implementable specifications through a structured, iterative process.

### Recursive Bilayer Architecture
The fundamental structural principle where each conceptual stratum contains its own bilayer of definitions and specifications, creating fractal-like organization.

### Human-AI Symbiosis
MDMD is designed from the ground up to support collaborative creation between human creativity and AI computational power.

### Bi-Directional Thinking
The methodology encourages thinking that flows both from high-level concepts down to implementation details and from concrete requirements up to architectural vision.

These concepts form the theoretical foundation for understanding how to effectively use MDMD in practice for design specification and implementation.
