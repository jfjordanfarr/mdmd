# MDMD Philosophy: The Executable Idea

## Vision

MDMD (Membrane Design MarkDown) aims to be a universal textual medium for progressively concretizing ideas into fully specified, actionable solutions across diverse domains (software, engineering, legal, creative arts, etc.). It facilitates a symbiotic collaboration between human intellect and Artificial Intelligence.

## Core Metaphor: The Bilayer Membrane

The design of any complex system can be conceptualized as a "bilayer membrane":

- **Inner Leaflet (The Concrete Contract):** The precise, verifiable interfaces and definitions of fundamental building blocks. These are the points of direct interaction with "reality" (e.g., executable code, physical material specifications, defined legal terms).
- **Outer Leaflet (The Conceptual Architecture):** The organization, relationships, interactions, and purpose of these building blocks, forming coherent larger structures and explaining the system's "why" and "how" at a human-understandable level.

MDMD provides the language to describe both leaflets and their interplay.

## Principles

1.  **Progressive Concretization:** Ideas -> High-Level Compositions -> Detailed Units -> Implementation.
2.  **Human Readability First:** Specifications must be clear and intuitive for human authors and reviewers.
3.  **AI Interpretability:** Structure must be sufficient for LLMs (guided by the MDMD Spec Doc) to understand, generate, and relate specifications to implementations.
4.  **Extensibility:** The system of types (`unit-type`, `composition-type`) must be open and adaptable to any domain.
5.  **Bi-Directional Thinking:** Encourage a fluid movement between specification and implementation, ideally with tooling to assist synchronization.
6.  **Openness:** The MDMD framework itself and its resultant specifications should be open and shareable.

## The Role of LLMs

LLMs act as:

- **Interpreters:** Understanding MDMD files guided by the MDMD Specification.
- **Generators:** Drafting MDMD content from high-level ideas or existing artifacts (code, documents).
- **Translators:** Bridging MDMD specifications to/from implementation-specific details.
- **Assistants:** Helping humans refine, link, and maintain MDMD documents.

MDMD is the structured language for this human-AI dialogue.
